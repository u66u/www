I changed my perspective about life and people in general while achieving most of my wishes.\n\nThis post wouldn't have been possible without the awesome people from Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jsngr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@jsngr</a>,\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/julianlehr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@julianlehr</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/peduarte\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@peduarte</a>,\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/brian_lovin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@brian_lovin</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pacocoursey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@pacocoursey</a>,\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/emilkowalski_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@emilkowalski_</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/raunofreiberg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@raunofreiberg</a>,\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/leerob\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@leerob</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ancashoria\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@ancashoria</a> - from which I learned a fair ammount of programming and took a lot of\ninspiration.\n\n## Year summary\n\nKnowing nothing about web development, I have started learning the basic steps. I liked the fact that I could combine my design skills\nwith programming. For about three months, I made mostly basic websites for various purposes. Until March I focused a lot on\nolympiads: competitive programming and mathematics - in which I qualified at the national stage and progressed a lot.\n\nFollowing that period, I tried ReactJs for the first time and was fascinated by its powers. Tutorial after tutorial, documentation after documentation,\nI liked the dynamic approach and the development experience. In April I accomplished one of my old dreams: getting a MacBook. Saving money for some time and Apple releasing the M1 Chip\ncouldn't have been timed better. I'm grateful for it - it surely made my life a lot easier.\n\nChanging the focus once again, I worked for about two months on our robot for the [First Tech Challenge](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc) Competition. A lot of research, prototyping,\nCAD designing and engineering were made alongside my team. Unfortunately, we didn't qualify for the next stage due to a robot component breaking a few days before the\nstart of the contest. Contrary to that, I won the [Dean's List](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc/deans-list) Award, selected from over 300 students from Romania - in recognition of leadership and dedication for leading the team to increase awareness for First and for achieving personal technical expertise and accomplishment.\n\nThinking that I need to level up the programming skills I took Harvard's CS50. I still believe that this is the best course ever made, as it helped me a lot to reach my desired level.\nMade my first internet money. Started prototyping in SwiftUI for some time, then came back to React, as it had a flatter learning curve. Multiple side projects later,\nI transitioned to the back-end using Ben Awad's [dream stack](https://twitter.com/benawad/status/1199337684734377991?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1199337684734377991%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.benawad.com%2Fwhat-is-the-best-graphql-stack-for-nodejs%2F).\nCreated some prototypes and planning to release a product next year.\n\nLater that autumn I got hired by a good friend of mine to work on multiple projects. That marked exactly 11 months after I started to learn web development.\nTowards the end of the year, I have experimented with interfaces, design systems, and flexible components.\n\nFor anyone wondering, this statistic was made using some spreadsheets combined with Apple's buggy Screen Time and Strava.\n\n## Advice\n\nI always thought that by helping others, you help yourself, so here are some of my takeaways from this year, including personal experience, books, and more:\n\n- Always work in Pomodoro sessions. Long studying sessions mean that you'll only remember the first 20 minutes and the last 20, and in between that you'll lose all the information.\n- To cut the learning curve, teach.\n- Ask questions. Ask the right questions.\n- Knowledge is not power. Knowledge times action is power.\n- Transform the FOMO into JOMO (Joy of missing out).\n- A clean environment is the best place to study.\n- Nothing is original.\n- You're only going to be as good as the stuff you surround yourself with.\n- It's always your job to get yourself an education.\n- Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver.\n- Sharpen the saw before you do anything else.\n- Talk about your own mistakes before criticising the other person.\n- Begin with the end in mind.\n- Don't break the chain. We work because it's a chain reaction, each subject leads to the next. Use the end of one project to light up the next one.\n- Creativity is not a talent. It's a way of operating.\n- Work is never finished, only abandoned.\n- Be kind.\n- **Go make that stuff.**\n\nThanks for reading. I hope 2022 is going to be a great year for everyone. WGMI.",
